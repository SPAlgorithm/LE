    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>
      LE Secure AI ("we", "our", or "us") operates the LE Secure AI Agent for WhatsApp and Telegram.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is processed when users interact with our service.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of Service</h2>
    <p>
      LE Secure AI provides security and encryption-related functionality only in response to user-initiated messages
      on supported messaging platforms. The service does not initiate conversations, send unsolicited messages,
      or deliver marketing, promotional, or bulk communications.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>
    <p>
      When a user initiates a message, we process:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phone number (used for message delivery and authentication)</li>
      <li>Message content submitted by the user for encryption or decryption</li>
      <li>Minimal technical metadata required to operate the messaging service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Information is processed solely to fulfill the user’s explicit request, such as encryption or decryption,
      PIN/password/OTP/time-based access controls, security validation, and response delivery.
      LE Secure AI does not analyze, profile, or reuse message content for any secondary purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.
      Data is shared only with messaging platforms (such as WhatsApp or Telegram) strictly as required to deliver
      the requested message, in accordance with their respective policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Message content is processed transiently and is not stored beyond the time required to complete the requested
      operation, unless explicitly stated for a specific feature.
    </p>
