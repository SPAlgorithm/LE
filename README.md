# LE Encryption & Decryption Commands

## ðŸ”¹ Install Steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or **download the zip**:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SPAlgorithm/LE.git
```
   Or download the zip and extract it.

2. **Install LE**:

   - Tap on **LE.dmg** and copy/move **LE** to a local folder.
   - Double click on **LELocation shortcut** to enable permissions.

3. **Setup LE**:

```bash
./LE --setup
```
   Or:
```bash
./LE -s
```

If you run setup, then you are agreeing to all the terms and conditions! LE uses location and messages services, please
enable these if you are using Geo Location and MFA capabilities.
 
This will create a `cer.le` certificate.You may be prompted to enter password of your machine in key chain.
If you want to buy licenced copy,please share `cer.le` with us. Contact **spalgorithm@gmail.com**.

4. **Encrypt a test file**:

```bash
echo Testing > example.txt
```
   
```bash
./LE -e example.txt -j
```   
   
   You should see **example.letxt** in the folder.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Create a Password Encryption File

1. **Create a password file**:

```bash
echo TestingPassword > pass.txt
```
   This password file now contains the password `"TestingPassword"`.

2. **Encrypt the password file**:

**The password file needs to be encrypted/decrypted with 4 digit pin , optional MFA enabled.**

```bash
./LE -e pass.txt -q -j -1 1234
```
   The password file (pass.letxt) is now encrypted with pin 1234 and can be used for encrypting files or folders.

```bash
./LE -e pass.txt -q -j -1 1234 -2 "+1XXXXXXXXX,+1YYYYYYYYYY"
```

The password file (pass.letxt) is now encrypted with pin 1234 and MFA where you will provide a valid phone
number (with +Country Code) where static otp can be send at the time of decrypting and can be used for encrypting files
or folders. If you use MFA option, you must use pin option. 

**Note: Please make sure that you have enabled messages app on your Mac.**


3. **Decrypt the password file**:

```bash
./LE -d pass.letxt -j -w TestingPassword -1 1234
```

To decrypt a password file, the user must **know the password** stored inside the password file.
Also,to decrypt a password file, the user must **4 digit pin**


```bash
./LE -4 pass.letxt -1 pin
```

To receive OTP, use above command.

```bash
./LE -d pass.letxt  -j -w TestingPassword -1 1234 -3 "123456"
```

To decrypt a password file, the user must **know the password** stored inside the password file.
Also,to decrypt a password file, the user must **4 digit pin**, static OTP (123456) send to your phone. 


---

## ðŸ”¹ Create a Location Encryption File

1. **Create a location file**:

**Location files needs to be encrypted/decrypted with 4 digit pin.**

If you know Latitude,Longitude and distance in meters:

```bash
echo "35.8538,-78.686,2000" > location.csv
```

```bash
echo "38.1233,-88.249,100" >> location.csv
```

   This location file now contains the array of geo locations `"Lattitude,Longitude,Distance to allow decrypt in meters".
**One Geo Location point per line.**

If you don'know Latitude and Longitude but have address:

You can build location file using precise Geo Points and distance using LE. You can append Geo location into location
file and build accurate location file.

```bash
./LE -x "1 Infinite Loop. Cupertino, CA 95014 United States" -m 100 >> location.csv
```

```bash
./LE -x "1560 Broadway, Manhattan, NY 10036 usa" -m 500 >> location.csv
```
    
Location.csv will contain 2 Geo Location points now if valid addresses are provided.
  
- **Geo Locations Limit**:

  - âš¡ **Beta Version**: Supports **up to 5 Geo Locations**.
  - ðŸš€ **Licensed Version**: Supports **up to 100 Geo Locations**.


2. **Encrypt the location file**:

**Without encrypted geo location point.**

```bash
./LE -e location.csv -v -1 1234 -j
```

The location file (location.lecsv) is now encrypted with pin 1234 and can be used for geo location encrypting files or folders.It does not include current location, only geo points you specified. 
   
**With encrypted geo location point and custom distance.**

To add current location of enryption and distance of 200 meters to your list 

```bash
./LE -e location.csv -v -1 1234 -g -m 200 -j
```

To Encrypt location file with pin and MFA :


```bash
./LE -e location.csv -v -1 1234 -j -2 "+1XXXXXXXXX,+1YYYYYYYYYY"
```

The location file (location.lecsv) is now encrypted with pin 1234 and can be used for geo location encrypting files or folders.It will add current geo location and distance of 200 meters.

**Get Info on encrypted location file**

```bash
./LE -i location.lecsv 
```

3. **Decrypt the location file**:

```bash
./LE -d location.lecsv -j -1 1234
```

You will need a valid pin to decrypt location file.

```bash
./LE -d location.lecsv -j -1 1234 -3 "123456"
```

You will need a valid pin and static OTP (123456) send to valid phone number you provided to decrypt location file.

**Note: Please make sure that you have enabled locations on your Mac.**

Ladhe's Encryption can play a crucial role in mitigating the **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)** threat, which is a major concern in the era of quantum computing.

How Ladheâ€™s Encryption Solves HNDL

1.**Quantum-Safe from Day Zero**

Unlike classical RSA and ECC, which are vulnerable to Shorâ€™s algorithm, Ladhe's Encryption is designed to be resistant to quantum attacks, making it an ideal defense against adversaries who collect encrypted data today with the hope of decrypting it in the future.

2.Unmatched Key Strength

Even Version 1.0 of Ladheâ€™s Encryption (with just a 9-byte public key) is trillions of times stronger than 4096-bit
RSA.This immense cryptographic strength ensures that data remains secure even against future advancements in computing
power.

3.**Dual Algorithm (Symmetric & Asymmetric Support)**

Supporting both symmetric and asymmetric encryption allows for dynamic adaptation, ensuring that even legacy systems can
transition to post-quantum security without sacrificing performance or compatibility.

4.**Crypto Agility**

Ladheâ€™s Encryption is designed for crypto agility, meaning it can be integrated into existing cryptographic infrastructures and updated as new threats emerge, preventing long-term vulnerabilities.
Resistant to Future Quantum Breakthroughs

Since it is not based on factorization, discrete logarithms, or elliptic curve cryptography, Ladheâ€™s Encryption does not
suffer from the weaknesses that quantum computers exploit.

Why Does This Matters?

Governments, enterprises, and individuals storing sensitive information today are at risk because encrypted data stolen
now can be decrypted later when quantum computers reach maturity. By adopting Ladheâ€™s Encryption now, organizations can
protect their critical data before itâ€™s too late.

---

**Challenge to break LE**:

While Ladheâ€™s Encryption may be at stage ZERO, but we boldly challenge QUANTUM computers, AI, ChatGPT, and the world's
smartest minds to break it! Our goal is to keep world safer!
