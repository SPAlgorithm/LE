# LE Encryption & Decryption Commands

## ðŸ”¹ Install Steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or **download the zip**:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SPAlgorithm/LE.git
```
   Or download the zip and extract it.

2. **Install LE**:

   - Tap on **LE.dmg** and copy/move **LE** to a local folder.
   - Double click on **LELocation shortcut** to enable permissions.

3. **Setup LE**:

```bash
./LE â€“setup
```
   Or:
```bash
./LE -s
```

This will create a `cer.le` certificate.You may be prompted to enter password of your machine in key chain.
If you want to buy licenced copy,please share `cer.le` with us. Contact **spalgorithm@gmail.com**.

4. **Encrypt a test file**:

```bash
echo Testing > example.txt
```
   
```bash
./LE -e example.txt -j
```   
   
   You should see **example.letxt** in the folder.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Create a Password Encryption File

1. **Create a password file**:

```bash
echo TestingPassword > pass.txt
```
   This password file now contains the password `"TestingPassword"`.

2. **Encrypt the password file**:

```bash
./LE -e pass.txt -q -j
```
   The password file (pass.letxt) is now encrypted and can be used for encrypting files or folders.

3. **Decrypt the password file**:

```bash
./LE -d pass.letxt -j -w TestingPassword
```
   To decrypt a password file, the user must **know the password** stored inside the password file.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Create a Location Encryption File

1. **Create a location file**:

If you know Latitude,Longitude and distance in meters:

```bash
echo "35.8538,-78.686,2000" > location.csv
```

```bash
echo "38.1233,-88.249,100" >> location.csv
```

   This location file now contains the array of geo locations `"Lattitude,Longitude,Distance to allow decrypt in meters".
**One Geo Location point per line.**

If you don'know Latitude and Longitude but have address:

You can build location file using precise Geo Points and distance using LE. You can append Geo location into location
file and build accurate location file.

```bash
./LE -x "1 Infinite Loop. Cupertino, CA 95014 United States" -m 100 >> location.csv
```

```bash
./LE -x "1560 Broadway, Manhattan, NY 10036 usa" -m 500 >> location.csv
```
    
Location.csv will contain 2 Geo Location points now if valid addresses are provided.
  
- **Geo Locations Limit**:

  - âš¡ **Beta Version**: Supports **up to 5 Geo Locations**.
  - ðŸš€ **Licensed Version**: Supports **up to 100 Geo Locations**.


2. **Encrypt the location file**:

**Without encrypted geo location point.**

```bash
./LE -e location.csv -v -j
```

The location file (location.lecsv) is now encrypted and can be used for geo location encrypting files or folders.It does not include current location, only geo points you specified. 
   
**With encrypted geo location point and custom distance.**

To add current location of enryption and distance of 200 meters to your list 

```bash
./LE -e location.csv -v -g -m 200 -j
```

The location file (location.lecsv) is now encrypted and can be used for geo location encrypting files or folders.It will add current geo location and distance of 200 meters.

**Get Info on encrypted location file**

```bash
./LE -i location.lecsv 
```


3. **Decrypt the location file**:

```bash
./LE -d location.lecsv -j 
```
